Hi! This is my README!

NOTE: Before beginning to navigate the page, MAKE SURE THE PAGE IS SCALED PROPERLY! It was formatted for a 1920x1080p monitor, so the background image should be completely centered on the page with no tiling, and there should be NO scroll bars!

The handmade website I created was an emulative endeavor to capture the nature, aesthetics, and selected content of old official game websites, making a dedicated "official" site for a fake game called Nightcap, for the Nintendo 64.
Its publishing date is 1997, so I had to reference websites from similar publishing dates as inspiration. The web archive luckily had saved several Nintendo 64 game's official sites, located here:

Also, the classic Battle.net site came in handy for its graphical presentation:

Creating this site was honestly a very taxing endeavor: not only was I designing the site itself, but also creating all the individual content and renders to be featured on each page. This took a lot of work to pass for the level of plausibility I was trying to achieve.

There was also a lot of finagling to get the content to formate in a desirable fashion, with lots of wrestling over various html elements. This was until I realized I should be directly referencing the formatting techniques of websites of that time period, and immediately went to One Terabyte of a Kilobyte age and inspected the element of an archived page, finding my solution: tables. Tabling fixed all of my problems, boxing up all of the content to align with the prerendered background.

My chosen pages were a homepage, story page, game mechanics page, enemy page, maps page, news page, and FAQ page. These were all pages I had seen on my reference sites and seems like a perfect variety of content to make the game seem believable, and more specifically, have the site feel real as an advertisement of the game. 

I specifically made no reference within the site to me, Simon, as a creator, trying to veil it under the guise of a studio producing this game and all of its complimentary promotional and digital material. This was an intentional choice I made for the sake of its presentation. My credits belong outside of it, within this README and through the forums of its submission.
